    "#  DATA Encryption Standard (DES)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that means for encryption and decryption it uses the same secret key which is shared among sender and receiver. DES is also a block cipher i.e. it process the input plain-text block by block and 64-bit is used as block size by DES. DES working is based on Feistel Structure [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher].\n",
    "\n",
    "## DES Subkey Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically DES uses 16 round of similar operation on input plain text with the help of unique key in each round. The unique key in fact is sub-key generated through the initial 64-bit key. Each round perform a Feistel function on half of plaintext (32-bit) and the 48-bit round key. So, to understand DES, one must have to understand about key generation, Feistel function, DES round operation for encryption and decryption. Please refer to Chapter 4 for details."

    "## Parity Drop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first step of subkey generation is **parity drop** which is carried out by the help of a permutation table (explain later), so this step also known as permutation step. The permutation table has 56 number between 1–64 in a predefined order and do has 8,16,24,32,40,48,56 and 64 (these are parities bits). For the Python implementation, this table can be consider as a list object and it value will be used as index to select bit from the initial 64-bit key string. Thus the resulting string will have 56 bits according to the permutation table."

Both half is then process separately in all round to generate the all 16 sub keys. splitting can be done in many ways in Python the easiest is by use of string slice because we know the length or each half. So, for easy handling this will be also implemented as Python method."

Currently, we will implement a circular left shift method which will take 28 bits, and number of shift position as input and return the circularly left shifted bits as output. Left shift can be achieved by bitwise operator but for the simplicity and easy understanding we will go with simple string slice method."
