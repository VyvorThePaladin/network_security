    "## DES Encryption\n",
    "DES encryption is a block cipher which it process plaintext in bunch and 64bit is block size used by DES and it takes 64-bit key which used to generate 16 subkey for each of the round. For example purpose, I will take plaintext and key in hexadecimal i.e. 16 hex digits for plaintext and same length hex for the key. We will have a hex to binary conversion function to convert this into binary. We will go with string processing method for easy illustration. Let suppose the plaintext (M) = ‘0123456789ABCDEF’ . Code below show the converstion from hex digits to binary equivalent. We have implemented two function hexString_to_binary_bits1() and hexString_to_binary_bits2(), one is just using mapping and other use Python inbuilt function int() and bin() for conversion. Either one can be use according to need."
