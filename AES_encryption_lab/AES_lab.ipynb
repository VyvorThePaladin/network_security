    "\n",
    "AES is an iterative rather than Feistel cipher. It is based on **substitution–permutation network**. It comprises of a series of linked operations, some of which involve replacing inputs by specific outputs (substitutions) and others involve shuffling bits around (permutations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, AES performs all its computations on *bytes* rather than *bits*. Hence, AES treats the 128 bits of a plaintext block as 16 bytes. These 16 bytes are arranged in four columns and four rows for processing as a matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike DES, the number of rounds in AES is variable and depends on the length of the key. AES uses 10 rounds for 128-bit keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit keys and 14 rounds for 256-bit keys. Each of these rounds uses a different 128-bit round key, which is calculated from the original AES key.\n",

    "- **ShiftRows: **each row in the state table is shifted by a varying number of bytes\n",
