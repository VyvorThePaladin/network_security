    "For AES, DES, or any block cipher, encryption is performed on a block of b  bits. In the case of DES, $b =  64$ and in the case of AES, $b = 128$. However, it is possible to convert a block cipher into a stream cipher, using one of the three modes: \n",

    "A stream cipher eliminates the need to pad a message to be an integral number of blocks. It also can operate in real time. Thus, if a character stream is being transmitted, each character can be encrypted and transmitted immediately using a character-oriented stream cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "One desirable property of a stream cipher is that the ciphertext be of the same length as the plaintext. Thus, if 8-bit characters are being transmitted, each character should be encrypted to produce a ciphertext output of 8 bits. If more than 8 bits are produced, transmission capacity is wasted."

As with CBC, the units of plaintext are chained together, so that the ciphertext of any plaintext unit is a function of all the preceding plaintext. In this case, rather than blocks of $b$ bits, the plaintext is divided into segments of $s$ bits.\n",

The leftmost (most significant) $s$  bits of the output of the encryption function are XORed with the first segment of plaintext $P_1$ to produce the first unit of ciphertext $C_1$, which is then transmitted. In addition, the contents of the shift register are shifted left by $s$ bits, and $C_1$  is placed in the rightmost (least significant) $s$ bits of the shift register. This process continues until all plaintext units have been encrypted.\n",

In CFB, the output of the XOR unit is fed back to become input for encrypting the next block. The other difference is that the OFB mode operates on full blocks of plaintext and ciphertext, whereas CFB operates on an s-bit subset.\n",

The reason for this is that the sequence of encryption output blocks, $O_i$ , depends only on the key and the IV and does not depend on the plaintext. Therefore, for a given key and IV, the stream of output bits used to XOR with the stream of plaintext bits is fixed. If two different messages had an identical block of plaintext in the identical position, then an attacker would be able to determine that portion of the $O_i$ stream.\n",

For example, if a bit error occurs in $C_1$ , only the recovered value of $P_1$  is affected; subsequent plaintext units are not corrupted. With CFB, $C_1$  also serves as input to the shift register and therefore causes additional corruption downstream.\n",

Further, all $T_i$  values across all messages must be unique. If, contrary to this requirement, a counter value is used multiple times, then the confidentiality of all of the plaintext blocks corresponding to that counter value may be compromised. In particular, if any plaintext block that is encrypted using a given counter value is known, then the output of the encryption function can be determined easily from the associated ciphertext block. This output allows any other plaintext blocks that are encrypted using the same counter value to be easily recovered from their associated ciphertext blocks.\n",
